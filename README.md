# ETL Project with Docker, Apache Airflow, Snowflake, Cosmos, and dbt

## Project Overview
This ETL project automates data extraction, transformation, and loading using a robust, containerized architecture. The setup integrates seamlessly with Snowflake for data storage and uses dbt for transformations. Cosmos simplifies dbt and Apache Airflow integration, providing a streamlined workflow orchestration.

## Key Technologies
- **Docker**: Provides a consistent and isolated environment for running services, simplifying deployment.
- **Apache Airflow**: Manages and schedules workflows, with features like monitoring, retries, and task management.
- **Snowflake**: Acts as the data warehouse for both raw and transformed data.
- **Cosmos**: Integrates dbt workflows into Apache Airflow, making orchestration easy and efficient.
- **dbt**: Transforms raw data into analysis-ready datasets.

## Architecture Overview
The ETL pipeline includes the following components:
1. **Data Ingestion**: Raw data is ingested into Snowflake.
2. **Data Transformation**: dbt transforms the raw data in Snowflake into clean, structured datasets.
3. **Workflow Orchestration**: Airflow, powered by Cosmos, manages the ETL process efficiently and reliably.

- **Raw Data** in Snowflake is transformed using **dbt**, and the output is stored back in Snowflake.
- **Cosmos** integrates with Airflow to manage dbt workflows.
- The entire setup is containerized and managed using **Docker**.

## Cosmos Features
Cosmos enhances the integration of dbt and Apache Airflow:
- **Automatic DAG Generation**: Transforms dbt workflows into Apache Airflow DAGs, saving development time.
- **Model-Centric Focus**: Lets you focus on building high-quality data models without worrying about orchestration.
- **Efficient Orchestration**: Manages dependencies, retries, alerting, and scheduling automatically.
  
Setup Instructions
===========================
### Prerequisites
-    Docker: Make sure Docker is installed and running on your system.
-    Snowflake Account: Set up and configure your Snowflake account.

## Steps to Run

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-directory>

2. **Build and Run Docker Containers**
    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    cd <repository-directory>
This command initializes the services, including Airflow, Snowflake integration, and dbt.

3. **Configure Airflow and Cosmos**
-    Set up the necessary Airflow connections for Snowflake and other dependencies.
-    Integrate Cosmos to manage dbt workflows efficiently.

4. **Run the ETL Workflow**
-    Use the Airflow UI to monitor and trigger DAGs.
-    Cosmos handles the orchestration, automatically generating Airflow DAGs from dbt workflows.
    
Monitoring and Troubleshooting
===========================
-    Use the Airflow Web UI to monitor task progress, view logs, and manage task retries.
-    Snowflake provides insights into the state of data before and after transformations.
-    dbt Logs: Check dbt logs for transformation-specific issues and troubleshooting.
  
Future Improvements
===========================
-    Add Data Quality Checks: Implement automated data validation to ensure data integrity.
-    Scalability Enhancements: Integrate more data sources and optimize data transformations for scalability.
-    Advanced Alerting: Set up custom alert mechanisms for better monitoring and quick issue resolution.
